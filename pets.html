      <h2>Official Statement</h2>
      <p>
        CK Adiithya Layout Residents Association recognises that many residents keep pets and that street dogs are present in and around our neighbourhood.
        The Association <strong>does not have the legal authority</strong> to issue orders, remove, rehome, capture, or otherwise take enforcement action regarding pets or stray animals.
      </p>

      <p class="card"><strong>Important:</strong> Any action related to capture, sterilisation, relocation, or removal of stray dogs must be carried out only by authorised government agencies or licensed animal welfare organisations, following the applicable laws and humane procedures.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why the Association cannot act directly</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The management of street animals falls under municipal/local civic authorities and animal welfare legislation. Residents should contact the local municipal corporation (BBMP for Bengaluru) or authorised animal welfare bodies.</li>
        <li>The Association does not have powers to detain, move, or perform medical procedures on animals — doing so may be illegal and unsafe.</li>
        <li>Any unauthorised interference can be harmful to animals and can expose residents or the Association to legal liability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What residents should do (humane & lawful options)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Report issues to municipal authorities:</strong> Lodge complaints with the local civic body or animal control / municipal animal welfare units. Provide location, photos and times when dogs are active.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact authorised animal-welfare organisations:</strong> Reach out to registered NGOs or societies that run Animal Birth Control (ABC) and vaccination programmes. They can handle sterilisation and vaccination campaigns legally and humanely.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not attempt to capture or relocate animals yourself:</strong> Avoid trapping, moving, or harming animals. If an animal is injured or dangerous, request assistance from an authorised agency or NGO trained in humane handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow safe practices around animals:</strong> Avoid provoking animals, secure household garbage, avoid feeding in public places, and use leashes for pets in common areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate neighbours:</strong> Encourage responsible pet ownership — vaccinations, sterilisation, and proper waste disposal reduce conflicts with stray animals.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How the Association will help</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We will share official contact information and any public awareness materials from municipal authorities or animal-welfare organisations with residents.</li>
        <li>The Association can facilitate information sharing (for example: collect reports from residents and forward them to the appropriate civic/animal-welfare authorities) but we cannot instruct or compel those authorities.</li>
        <li>The Association may organise awareness sessions or help coordinate voluntary, lawful vaccination / sterilisation drives with authorised NGOs when residents request and when the relevant organisations are available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt style="font-weight:700;margin-top:12px">Q — Can the Association order removal of street dogs from the layout?</dt>
        <dd>A — No. Only municipal/authorised agencies can handle control or sterilisation under applicable laws. The Association cannot order removal, transfer, or euthanasia.</dd>

        <dt style="font-weight:700;margin-top:12px">Q — What if a dog bites a resident?</dt>
        <dd>A — Immediately seek medical attention. Then report the incident to local health/municipal authorities and to the police if required. The Association can help document the incident for your report.</dd>

        <dt style="font-weight:700;margin-top:12px">Q — Who do we contact for sterilisation/vaccination drives?</dt>
        <dd>A — Contact registered animal welfare NGOs operating in Bengaluru or your municipal animal welfare unit. The Association can publish contact details if residents request them.</dd>

        <dt style="font-weight:700;margin-top:12px">Q — Can residents feed street dogs?</dt>
        <dd>A — Feeding in designated private premises is the individual's choice, but feeding in shared public spaces may increase conflict and attract more animals. If you feed, please do so responsibly and avoid leaving waste in common areas.</dd>
